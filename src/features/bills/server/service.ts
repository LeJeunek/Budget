 *
 * Idempotency: `@@unique([billId, dueDate])` (prisma/schema.prisma) is what
 * makes `skipDuplicates` safe to rely on instead of an existence check before
 * every insert — two concurrent reads racing to generate the same occurrence
 * both succeed, at most one row is ever created for a given (billId,
 * dueDate) pair, per the schema comment on that constraint.
 *
 * Deliberately takes the already-fetched `bill` row (not just a `billId`)
 * rather than re-querying `Bill` internally — every caller below already has
 * the row in hand from its own list/detail query, and api-contracts.md's own
 * description of this mechanism ("ensureOccurrencesGenerated(bill,
 * throughDate)") is framed the same way; re-fetching would be a redundant
 * round-trip for no benefit.
 *
 * `minThroughDate`, when supplied, extends the horizon to at least that date
 * (used by `getCalendarMonth` so a user paging several months ahead still
 * sees materialized occurrences for that specific month) — this remains
 * bounded (a single requested month, not an open-ended range) per the
 * performance guidance cited above, it just isn't hardcoded to always equal
 * `DEFAULT_HORIZON_MONTHS`.
 *
 * Archived bills (bills.md AC5) are a deliberate no-op here — they generate
 * no further occurrences while archived. Resuming generation on reactivation
 * "from that point forward" (without backfilling the archived gap) is handled
 * by `server/actions.ts`'s `unarchiveBill`, not here — see that function's
 * JSDoc for why that specific behavior can't live in this general-purpose,
