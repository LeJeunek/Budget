/**
 * PURE status math for the Bills module — no Prisma calls, no
 * `getCurrentUser()`, no I/O of any kind. Per docs/architecture/folder-tree.md's
 * Phase 2 section, this split exists specifically so the recurrence-generation
 * and status-computation logic (the two easiest things to get subtly wrong in
 * this feature, per date-math and boundary-condition bugs) is unit-testable
 * in isolation, without a database, by the Integration Test Engineer's
 * recurrence-correctness test matrix (docs/product/bills.md's Definition of
 * Done).
 *
 * (Phase 3a) The date-cadence math this file used to own directly
 * (`toUtcMidnight`/`addUtcDays`/`addUtcMonths`/next-due-date generation) is
 * now imported from `@/lib/recurrence.ts`, shared with Recurring Income's own
 * `features/recurring-income/server/occurrence.ts`, per
 * docs/architecture/api-contracts.md's Bills section ("its date-cadence math
 * ... is extracted to lib/recurrence.ts ... computeStatus (Bills-specific
 * wording, incl. 'Late') stays in bills/server/occurrence.ts unchanged").
 * This file re-exports those three date helpers under their original names
 * so every existing external caller (`server/service.ts`, `server/
 * actions.ts`) is unaffected by the extraction — a pure refactor, not a
 * behavior change. `computeNextDueDate` keeps its Bills-specific name/
 * signature as a thin wrapper around the shared `computeNextRecurrenceDate`.
 * `computeOccurrenceStatus`/`isOccurrencePaid` (Bills' own status vocabulary)
 * are unchanged below.
 *
 * `server/service.ts` is the only caller — it supplies real `Date`s read from
 * (or about to be written to) Postgres and interprets the results; this file
 * never touches the database itself.
