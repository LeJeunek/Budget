 *     account's own sign rule) — never the old account's arithmetic carried

 * every child row pointing at it via that foreign key, and (by the same
 * cascade rule applied transitively) each child's own `TransactionTag` and
 * `Receipt` rows. No explicit cascade logic is implemented here for those —
 * docs/product/transactions.md AC10's "user is warned about this before
 * confirming" is a Frontend Lead concern (a confirmation dialog before
 * calling this action), not something this action needs to re-implement.
 *
 * **Phase 2 addition (Receipts):** the DB cascade above deletes `Receipt`
 * *rows*, but it cannot reach into UploadThing storage and delete the actual
 * files those rows pointed at — per prisma/schema.prisma's comment on the
 * `Receipt` model, that is this action's job, per
 * docs/architecture/api-contracts.md's Receipts section ("`deleteTransaction`
 * ... must be updated to also call `utapi.deleteFiles(...)` for every
 * receipt attached to the transaction being deleted"). Every receipt on the
 * transaction itself *and* on any of its split children is purged — a split
 * parent's children are cascade-deleted transitively by the same `delete`
 * call below, so their receipts would otherwise become silent storage
 * orphans (no `Receipt` row survives to ever reference them again), which is
 * exactly the "no orphaned file left in storage" requirement from the
 * addendum's Edge Cases. Storage files are purged *before* the transaction
 * row is deleted — same ordering rationale as `server/receipts.ts`'s
 * `removeReceipt`: if the storage purge fails, this returns early and
 * nothing is deleted yet, so the transaction/receipts stay in sync and the
 * user can simply retry, rather than risking a storage failure *after* the
 * DB rows are already gone (which would permanently orphan the files with no
 * row left to ever reference them).
 *
 * **Account Balance Auto-Adjustment addition (Criterion 3,
 * docs/product/accounts-balance-auto-adjustment.md):** reverses this
 * transaction's balance effect atomically with the row's deletion — both
 * live in the same `db.$transaction` below.
 *
 * If this row is a split PARENT (has one or more rows pointing at it via
 * `parentTransactionId`), its own `amount` has had zero balance effect since
 * the moment it was split (Criterion 4) — there is nothing of the parent's
 * own to reverse. Instead, each CHILD's own *current* balance effect is
 * reversed (Criterion 3's cascade rule / the Edge Case "a split child's
 * category or amount was later changed... the cascade-delete must reverse
 * whatever each child's *current* balance effect is at time of deletion, not
 * its original as-created effect" — reading each child's own `amount` and
 * `account.type` fresh here, rather than assuming it still matches whatever
 * the split created it with, is exactly what satisfies that). A plain
 * (non-parent) transaction — including an ordinary split CHILD being
 * deleted on its own, which is how "un-splitting" works per the spec's "no
 * merge back" limitation — reverses its own current effect the same way any
 * ordinary transaction delete would.
