// into it, and this module's `listTransactions`/`TransactionFilterSchema`
// need the identical value so a user picking "Uncategorized" in the
// transaction table's category filter matches the same bucket the Dashboard
// chart shows. Duplicating the literal in two files would risk them drifting
// out of sync silently (e.g. one file typo'd to "uncategorised"); re-exporting
// the single source of truth makes that impossible. See
// features/dashboard/types.ts for the full rationale.

 * Client-safe representation of a financial Account.

 * Component -> Client Component boundary, or through a Server Action's
 * response, is unsafe. `server/service.ts` and `server/actions.ts` always
 * convert Decimal -> number before returning data, so every consumer outside
 * `features/transactions/server` works with this plain-number shape instead
 * of the raw Prisma type — mirrors `features/accounts/types.ts`'s `Account`/
 * `toAccount()` pattern.

 * row (merchant, category, account, tags) without N+1 client-side fetches —
 * see `server/service.ts`'s `TRANSACTION_INCLUDE` for the exact Prisma
 * `include` this shape is built from.
 *
 * Split transactions: for a parent that has been split, `amount` remains the
 * original total but is purely informational once split children exist (see
 * the schema comment on `Transaction.parentTransactionId`) — parents are
 * excluded from `listTransactions` results entirely (see
 * `EXCLUDE_SPLIT_PARENTS` in server/service.ts), so UI code only ever
 * encounters this "informational parent" shape via `getTransactionById` if
