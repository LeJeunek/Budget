"use client"

/**
 * DashboardShell — thin Client Component wrapper composing `Sidebar` /
 * `TopNav` / `BottomNav` / `children` for the authenticated app shell.
 *
 * Why this file exists (Phase 5a,
 * docs/architecture/phase-5a-technical-design.md §2.2): `BottomNav`'s
 * "More" button and `TopNav`'s hamburger `Sheet` must open/close the exact
 * same mobile-nav surface rather than each owning an independent, competing
 * `Sheet` (see the architecture doc's rejected alternatives). That requires
 * one `useState<boolean>` shared by both — but `(dashboard)/layout.tsx` is a
 * Server Component (it awaits `getCurrentUser()`/`getUserPreference()`), and
 * `useState` requires a Client Component. This file is the minimal
 * `"use client"` boundary that owns that one lifted `mobileNavOpen` boolean
 * and threads it into `TopNav`'s new, optional, controlled-mode props
 * (`mobileNavOpen`/`onMobileNavOpenChange` — see `top-nav.tsx`'s own JSDoc)
 * and `BottomNav`'s `onMoreClick`. It is pure composition/state-lifting, not
 * a new reusable component — mirrors `currency-preference-provider.tsx`'s
 * own "root-layout plumbing, not a components/shared/ primitive" ownership
 * note, and the same co-located `*-client.tsx` pattern this app already uses
 * for every Server Component page that needs a client-side composition root
 * (e.g. `bills/bills-client.tsx`, `transactions/transactions-client.tsx`).
 *
 * `<main>` gains `pb-16 sm:pb-0` here (not in `layout.tsx`) since `<main>` is
 * rendered by this same composition — matching bottom padding to
 * `BottomNav`'s own height so its fixed position never obscures page content
 * below `sm` (640px), per the architecture doc §2.4's "required companion
 * change, not optional."
 *
 * **Bug fix (Bug Hunter, Phase 5a review gate,
 * phase-5a-sheet-focus-return-broken-for-externally-triggered-sheets.md):**
 * Radix's `Sheet` restores focus, on close, to whatever DOM node it has
 * internally tracked as its own `SheetTrigger` (the hamburger button,
 * always) — so closing a Sheet opened via `BottomNav`'s "More" button
 * incorrectly returned focus to the unrelated hamburger button instead.
 * `lastMobileNavOpenTriggerRef` records `document.activeElement` (the
 * "More" button itself, since a clicked element is focused before its own
 * `onClick` fires) at the moment `onMoreClick` opens the Sheet via this
 * *external* path; `handleMobileNavCloseAutoFocus`, wired to `TopNav`'s new
 * `onSheetCloseAutoFocus` prop, manually restores focus there and
 * `preventDefault()`s Radix's own (in this one case, wrong) default —
 * clearing the ref afterward so the next hamburger-triggered open/close
 * cycle is untouched and keeps using Radix's own already-correct default
 * (the ref stays `null` whenever the hamburger's real `SheetTrigger` is
 * what opened it).
 *
 * Everything server-resolved (the signed-in user, notification bell JSX,
 * `children`) is passed in as props from `layout.tsx` — this file fetches
 * nothing itself.
