/**
 * Transactions page (Phase 1) — replaces the Phase 0 placeholder.
 *
 * A Server Component, not a Client Component, specifically so it can fetch
 * categories: per docs/architecture/api-contracts.md's Categories "List
 * categories" row, that module has no client hook or REST list route
 * (unlike Accounts/Transactions) — it's "a Server Component direct call to
 * `service.getCategories(userId)`". `getCategoryUsageCount` is likewise a
 * plain Server-only function, not a Server Action, so it can only be called
 * from here too. Both are threaded down as props to `TransactionsClient`,
 * the Client Component that actually owns the interactive table/dialogs.
 *
 * `getCurrentUser()` + redirect mirrors `(dashboard)/layout.tsx`'s own
 * guard — defensive, not load-bearing (the layout already redirects
 * unauthenticated visitors before this page renders), but required so
 * `getCategories`/`getCategoryUsageCount` have a non-null `userId` to scope
 * their queries by, per folder-tree.md's rule that every server query must
 * be scoped by the authenticated user's id.
 *
 * Usage counts are only computed for custom (non-system) categories — only
 * those are deletable (system categories are protected), so a usage count
 * for a system category would never be read. Counts are precomputed once
 * per page load, not fetched live at delete-confirmation time; see
 * `CategoryManagerDialog`'s JSDoc for how it stays reasonably fresh
 * (`router.refresh()` on every dialog open and after every mutation).
 *
 * **Phase 4a addition (Transaction Auto-Categorization):** `pendingSuggestions`
 * is fetched here for the same reason `categories` is — per
 * docs/architecture/api-contracts.md's Feature 1 row, `getPendingSuggestions`
 * is a plain Server Component direct call, not a client-fetchable route, so
 * it can only be read from this Server Component and threaded down as a
 * prop. It is intentionally unfiltered (every currently-PENDING suggestion
 * for this user, both automatic and manual "reconsider" origin) — see
 * `categorization.ts`'s own JSDoc on why the `importBatchId` scoping named in
 * the API contract isn't implemented yet (no column exists to group
 * transactions by import batch).
